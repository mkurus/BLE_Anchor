# Set the patch ID and user build numbers.  The patch ID is an 8-bit number, and

# The patch ID and user build number provides a means to identify the patch in
# memory, and help manage patches.  A user build number of 0 is reserved to EM use.
# A non-zero user build number identifies the patch or container as a user patch.
